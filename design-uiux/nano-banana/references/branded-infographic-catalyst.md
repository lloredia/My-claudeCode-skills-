```

## Prompting Philosophy: Let the Model Compose

**Key insight:** Generative image models perform better when given conceptual direction rather than pixel-level prescriptions.

### What to Specify
- **Content:** The information/concept to visualize
- **Palette:** Which color option (Calm Luxury or Sage & Sand)
- **Tone:** The feeling (professional, approachable, bold)
- **Format:** Aspect ratio and intended use
- **Relationships:** How elements relate (X synthesizes Y, A leads to B)

### What to Leave to the Model
- Layout and element placement
- Exact proportions and spacing
- Decorative elements and visual flourishes
- Typography choices within the brand aesthetic
- How to create visual hierarchy

### Example Contrast

❌ **Over-prescribed (worse results):**
> "Create a 16:9 infographic with title centered at top in 48pt Teal text, 6 boxes arranged in 2 rows of 3 columns, each box 200px wide with 8px rounded corners, icons 40px inside each box..."

✅ **Conceptual + constrained (better results):**
> "Infographic: '6 Dimensions of Writing Quality' - Craft, Coherence, Authority, Purpose, Voice, and Effectiveness (which synthesizes the other five). Calm Luxury palette. Professional, clean, generous white space. The relationship between dimensions should be visually clear."

### Why This Works
The model has internalized millions of well-designed compositions. Over-specifying fights its natural instincts. Your job is to provide the *what* and *why*; let the model figure out the *how*.

## Usage Examples

### Substack Article Header

**User input:**
> "Create a header image for my Substack article titled '5 Signs Your Business Is Ready for AI Implementation'"

**Result:** A 16:9 header with the title in Sage Green, a subtle pathway/checklist visual metaphor, Warm Sand container element, and generous white space. Clean, modern, immediately branded.

### LinkedIn Infographic

**User input:**
> "Create a LinkedIn infographic showing the AI implementation journey: Assess, Plan, Implement, Optimize"

**Result:** A square or 4:5 vertical graphic with four connected nodes/steps, each with an icon, Sage Green as the primary color, Terracotta highlighting the current/key step, clean typography.

### Framework Diagram

**User input:**
> "Visualize my AI Readiness Framework with three pillars: People, Process, Technology"

**Result:** A clean diagram with three columns or pillars, Sage Green headers, Sand background panels for each pillar's details, subtle connecting elements, Terracotta accent on the key insight.

## Format Quick Reference

| Format | Aspect Ratio | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Substack header | 16:9 or 2:1 | Article headers, featured images |
| LinkedIn post | 1:1 or 4:5 | Social sharing, engagement posts |
| LinkedIn article | 16:9 | Article headers on LinkedIn |
| Presentation | 16:9 | Slides, deck visuals |
| Long infographic | 2:3 or 9:16 | Detailed explainers, processes |
| Twitter/X | 16:9 or 2:1 | Social cards, quick visuals |

## Integration with Nano Banana Pro

### Step 1: Generate the infographic

```
gemini_generate_image(
  prompt="[System prompt above] + Content: '3 Pillars of AI Readiness: People, Process, Technology - with brief descriptions for each' + Format: linkedin + Aspect ratio: 1:1",
  model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
  aspectRatio="1:1",
  imageSize="4K"
)
```

### Step 2: Add Catalyst AI branding (Post-Processing)

After generating the infographic, add the Catalyst AI watermark using ImageMagick:

```bash
# Recommended: ImageMagick for pixel-perfect logo
magick /path/to/generated-infographic.png \
  \( /path/to/assets/catalyst-watermark-logo.png -resize 5% -alpha set -channel A -evaluate multiply 0.85 +channel \) \
  -gravity SouthEast -geometry +10+10 -composite \
  /path/to/output-branded.png
```

**Fallback (if ImageMagick unavailable):**
```
gemini_edit_image(
  imagePath="[path to generated infographic]",
  instructions="Add Catalyst AI Services branding in the bottom right corner: a tiny circular badge (4-5% of image width) with '© CATALYST AI' curved at top, 'SERVICES' curved at bottom, and a cute robot waving in the center (black line art). Subtle, 85% opacity, small margin from edge."
)
```

**Logo asset:** `assets/catalyst-watermark-logo.png` - circular badge with © symbol incorporated.
